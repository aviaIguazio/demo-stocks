ByteDance has agreed to divest parts of TikTok, sources have said, under pressure from the White House, which has threatened to ban it and other Chinese-owned apps over data security concerns.\\\\nThe launch escalates a bruising fight between Facebook and TikTok, with each casting the other as a threat. Both have been eager to attract American teenagers, many of whom have flocked to TikTok in the last two years. \\\\nReels was first tested in Brazil in 2018 and then later in France, Germany and India, which was TikTok s biggest market until the Indian government banned it last month following a border clash with China. Facebook also tried out a standalone app called Lasso which did not gain much traction.\\\\nSimilar to TikTok, Reels users can record short mobile-friendly vertical videos, then add special effects and soundtracks pulled from a music library.\\\\nThose similarities led TikTok Chief Executive Kevin Mayer to call Reels a \\\\\"copycat product\\\\\" that could coast on Instagram s enormous existing user base after \\\\\"their other copycat Lasso failed quickly.\\\\\"\\\\nFacebook faced similar charges at a congressional hearing on U.S. tech companies  alleged abuse of market power last week, with lawmakers suggesting the company has copied rivals like Snapchat for anti-competitive reasons.\\\\nVishal Shah, Instagram s vice president of product, acknowledged the similarities in a Tuesday video conference call with reporters and said that \\\\\"inspiration for products comes from everywhere,\\\\\" including Facebook s teams and \\\\\"the ecosystem more broadly.\\\\\"\\\\nInstagram is not yet planning to offer advertising or other ways for users to make money through Reels, although it did recruit young online stars like dancer Merrick Hanna and musician Tiagz - who was recently signed by Sony/ATV after rising to fame via TikTok memes - to test the product ahead of launch.\\\\nThe company paid the creators for production costs, Shah said.\\\\nJoe Gagliese, chief executive of influencer marketing agency Viral Nation, said Reels was poised to mimic Instagram s success with Stories, a product modeled on Snapchat s core offering.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"They re a huge monstrous threat (to TikTok),\\\\\" he said. \\\\\"The current turmoil couldn t be playing more into (Instagram s) court to launch this thing.\\\\\"\", \"time\": \"2020-08-05 00:00:00\", \"symbol\": \"MSFT\", \"link\": \"https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/facebook-launches-tiktoklike-product-inside-instagram-2254535\", \"sentiment\": -0.3333333333333333}, {\"content\": \"By Yasin Ebrahim\\\\nInvesting.com \\\\u2013 Wall Street ended higher on Wednesday on optimism that U.S. lawmakers will agree to a fresh round of coronavirus stimulus sooner than later.\\\\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.39%, or 372 points.

The hugely popular video-sharing app has come under fire from U.S. lawmakers and the administration over national security concerns, amid intensified tensions between Washington and Beijing.\\\\n\\\\\"With parent companies based in China, apps like TikTok, WeChat and others are significant threats to personal data of American citizens, not to mention tools for CCP (Chinese Communist Party) content censorship,\\\\\" Pompeo said.\\\\nIn an interview with state news agency Xinhua on Wednesday, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said the United States \\\\\"has no right\\\\\" to set up the \\\\\"Clean Network\\\\\" and calls the actions by Washington as \\\\\"a textbook case of bullying\\\\\". \\\\n\\\\\"Anyone can see through clearly that the intention of the U.S. is to protect it s monopoly position in technology and to rob other countries of their proper right to development,\\\\\" said Wang.\\\\nTikTok currently faces a deadline of Sept. 15 to either sell its U.S. operations to  Microsoft Corp   or face an outright ban.\\\\nIn the run-up to Trump s November re-election bid, U.S.-China ties are at the lowest ebb in decades. Relations are strained over the global coronavirus pandemic, China s military buildup in the South China Sea, its increasing control over Hong Kong and treatment of Uighur Muslims, as well as Beijing s massive trade surpluses and technological rivalry.\\\\nPompeo said the United States was working to prevent Chinese telecoms firm Huawei Technologies Co Ltd from pre-installing or making available for download the most popular U.S. apps on its phones.\\\\n\\\\\"We don t want companies to be complicit in Huawei s human rights abuses, or the CCP s surveillance apparatus,\\\\\" Pompeo said, without mentioning any specific U.S. companies.\\\\nPompeo said the State Department would work with other government agencies to protect the data of U.S. citizens and American intellectual property, including COVID-19 vaccine research, by preventing access from cloud-based systems run by companies such as  Alibaba  , Baidu , China Mobile , China Telecom , and Tencent (HK:0700).\\\\nPompeo said he was joining Attorney General William Barr, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, and Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf in urging the U.S. telecoms regulator, the Federal Communications Commission, to terminate authorizations for China Telecom and three other companies to provide services to and from the United States.\\\\nHe said the State Department was also working to ensure China could not compromise information carried by undersea cables that connect the United States to the global internet.\\\\nThe United States has long been lobbying European and other allies to persuade them to cut out Huawei from their telecommunications networks. Huawei denies it spies for China and says the United States wants to frustrate its growth because no U.S. company offers the same technology at a competitive price.\\\\nPompeo s comments on Wednesday reflected a wider and more accelerated push by Washington to limit the access of Chinese technology companies to U.S. market and consumers and, as one U.S. official put it, to push back against a \\\\\"massive campaign to steal and weaponize our data against us.\\\\\"\\\\nA State Department statement said momentum for the Clean Network program was growing and more than 30 countries and territories were now \\\\\"Clean Countries\\\\\" and many of the world s biggest telecommunications companies \\\\\"Clean Telcos.\\\\\"\\\\nIt called on U.S. allies \\\\\"to join the growing tide to secure our data from the CCP s surveillance state and other malign entities.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nHuawei Technologies and Tencent declined to comment.

Shares in that IPO tripled to $90 from their offering price of $24 during the day, and closed around $74.\\\\nMost everyone is waiting on the government s job report for July, which comes out on Friday, but there is still evidence that the economic revival after Covid-19 shutdowns was hitting a few snags.\\\\nHere are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:\\\\n1. Will another bailout boost the struggling airlines industry?\\\\nAirlines jumped late Wednesday after news that GOP Senators backed another $25 billion in support for the ailing industry. The ETF tracking the sector, U.S. Global Jets ETF , rose 3% and individual airlines also rose, including JetBlue Airways Corp  and United Airlines Holdings Inc , up more than 4%, and  American Airlines Group   up nearly 9%.\\\\nTravel shriveled up in the spring as people hunkered down at home to prevent the spread of Covid-19. With some new restrictions imposed to stamp out fresh virus outbreaks across the country, expectations are low that tourists and business people will return to the air in significant numbers for the near term. Airlines already received a $32 billion bailout in March.\\\\n2. This week the data is focused on jobs\\\\nThe weekly initial jobless claims number will be reported on Thursday as usual at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). The expectation is that 1.4 million Americans filed for unemployment for the first time last week, about even with the prior week and elevated from lower levels about a month ago.\\\\nBut most people are focused on Friday s nonfarm payroll report, which is expected to show an addition of 1.6 million jobs in July, and private nonfarm payrolls rising 1.47 million. That would be a big contrast to a private payroll processor s assessment released Wednesday. The ADP report on private payrolls showed only 167,000 jobs were added last month.\\\\nFriday s report is also expected to reveal changes in the unemployment rate, which is still at highs not seen since after World War II.\\\\n3.

With some new restrictions imposed to stamp out fresh virus outbreaks across the country, expectations are low that tourists and business people will return to the air in significant numbers for the near term. Airlines already received a $32 billion bailout in March.\\n2. This week the data is focused on jobs\\nThe weekly initial jobless claims number will be reported on Thursday as usual at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). The expectation is that 1.4 million Americans filed for unemployment for the first time last week, about even with the prior week and elevated from lower levels about a month ago.\\nBut most people are focused on Friday s nonfarm payroll report, which is expected to show an addition of 1.6 million jobs in July, and private nonfarm payrolls rising 1.47 million. That would be a big contrast to a private payroll processor s assessment released Wednesday. The ADP report on private payrolls showed only 167,000 jobs were added last month.\\nFriday s report is also expected to reveal changes in the unemployment rate, which is still at highs not seen since after World War II.\\n3.

Its unfolded display measures 7.6 inches (19.3 cm).\\nThe new iteration is thinner than the first Fold, and the hinge is improved to be more resilent, Samsung said. \\nSamsung did not disclose the phone s price, but said more details and preorders will be available on Sept. 1. \\nThe new Note 20 boasts a larger screen at 6.7 inches (17 cm), 5G connectivity, enhanced writing features with its S-Pen stylus, and access to more than 100 console and PC games via a tie-up with  Microsoft Corp  s  Xbox cloud service. \\nIt will go on sale on Aug. 21 in about 70 countries, including the United States, where the basic version will retail for $999, compared with its predecessor s $949. \\n\\\"It is an uncertain time to launch a new premium device given the challenging competitive and economic environments,\\\" said Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight Tech, adding that the \\\"eye-watering price\\\" could deter some buyers. \\nApple fans are unlikely to jump ship to the new Samsung model as the 5G iPhone is likely to be launched later this year, analysts say. \\nSamsung posted a 29% on-year drop in shipments in the June quarter, the biggest fall among top vendors, according to researcher IDC. Apple, which launched the budget-friendly SE during the period, remained resilient with 11% on-year shipment growth, while Huawei posted only a 5% fall. \\nThe global smartphone market shrank about 16% on-year in the April-June quarter due to COVID-19 lockdowns and consumer caution, a larger contraction than in the first quarter, and is expected to improve only slightly in the second half, IDC said.\\n\\n\\\"Before the Covid-19 existed, Samsung\\u2019s flagship launch usually had a big splash. ...

A source familiar with the effort confirmed the talks to Reuters. Discussions ultimately stalled, and by 2018 Facebook executives believed TikTok was not retaining U.S. users long-term, another source said.\\n* In mid-2018, ByteDance began an aggressive push aimed at growing TikTok s U.S. footprint, surging app-install ads on Facebook s ad network. At the peak, it was responsible for nearly 22% of all such ads on U.S. Apple  devices, according to data from Sensor Tower. It cut back drastically in 2019 once TikTok gained a teenage following and shifted to building an ads business to compete against Facebook.\\n* As Facebook came under pressure in Washington, it pushed back on calls to regulate U.S. tech companies by invoking the specter of an internet dominated by Chinese firms. Zuckerberg warned in a speech last year that China was \\\"exporting their vision of the internet to other countries.\\\" The U.S. government initiated a national security review of Utterance s Musical.ly acquisition late last year, after lawmakers expressed concerns around data security and censorship.\\n\\n* With the launch of Reels, Facebook is offering similar functionality to TikTok from within Instagram, which already boasts vast user numbers. The company recruited young TikTok stars to use the new service ahead of its launch, offering to cover production costs. In a blog post, TikTok s chief executive dismissed Reels as a \\\"copycat product\\\" and slammed Facebook for its \\\"maligning attacks ... disguised as patriotism.\\\"\", \"time\": \"2020-08-05 00:00:00\", \"symbol\": \"MSFT\", \"link\": \"https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/factbox-facebook-and-tiktoks-fraught-history-2254860\", \"sentiment\": -0.75}, {\"content\": \"By Yasin Ebrahim\\nInvesting.com \\u2013 Wall Street jumped on Wednesday as signs of progress on Capitol Hill over the next coronavirus fiscal stimulus package lifted investor sentiment.\\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.24 %, or 331 points.
